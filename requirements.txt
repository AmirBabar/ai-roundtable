# AI Roundtable - Optional Python Dependencies
#
# The core skill requires ZERO dependencies - it works entirely with
# Claude Code's native capabilities.
#
# These dependencies are OPTIONAL and only needed for enhanced features:
# - LiteLLM gateway (multi-model routing)
# - Dashboard (web UI)
# - Memory subsystem (persistent context)
#
# Install only what you need:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Or install individual components:
#   pip install litellm           # For multi-model gateway
#   pip install flask              # For dashboard

# LiteLLM Gateway (for multi-model routing)
litellm>=1.0.0

# Dashboard (web UI for monitoring)
flask>=3.0.0
werkzeug>=3.0.0

# HTTP client for API calls
requests>=2.31.0

# YAML configuration parsing
pyyaml>=6.0.0

# Environment variable loading
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Note: The following are STANDARD LIBRARY and don't need installation:
# - sqlite3 (memory database)
# - pathlib (path handling)
# - json (data serialization)
# - logging (error handling)
